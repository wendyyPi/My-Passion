    <h2 class="textheader-h2">My Reflection</h2>
    <p class="mission-p">
        Through my experience with website design, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the design
        process. I learned that creating a website involves first writing the HTML code, then adding CSS for
        style and design, and finally using JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality. To illustrate,
        HTML serves as the basic structure of the website, like a human with basic head, body and foot. While
        CSS is similar to the human clothing or makeup that enhance appearance and make the human looks more nice, JavaScript functions like
        actions that make a person more dynamic, like smiling, running, or jumping. Also, I think website
        design is an iterative process and require continuous improvement. when design my website, I
        begin by creating a rough website and then continuously enhance it by adding or modifying elements to
        make it more visually appealing. Additionally, I found it helpful to test my website with friends
        to obtain feedback, allowing me to identify areas for improvement and enhance its usability.
        One important lesson I learned is the value of planning carefully from the outset. If I could go back in
        time, I would prototype the entire website layout and color scheme before coding. As
        Initially, I just find some basic website wireframe online and start to code right away.
        Then during the coding process, I find it is hard to organise various parts and I spend more time
        adjusting my website which was inefficient. To avoid this in the future, I have learned to prioritize
        planning before beginning the website design process.
